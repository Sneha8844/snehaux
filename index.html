<p class="small disclaimer-text mb-3">
  Disclaimer: Since this is a prompt from my Google UX Certification course, it’s a hypothetical case. I referred to Google and other websites to do the secondary research. For the primary research, I visited a local store near my hometown that’s similar to the one I’m designing, to interact with real shoppers.
</p>
<h3 class="responsive-style section-spacing">SECONDARY RESEARCH</h3>
<p class=" text-light mb-4">
  Also known as desk research. I think this stage is crucial to understand the field, spot gaps and learn about real pain points  people facing during an instore grocery shopping. Since, i have limitations to do expensive/ time-consuming research processes. This gives real insights rather than assuming. I collected data’s relevant to the context. Here’s what i found:
</p>
<h3 class="subsection-title ">Contextual Insights</h3>
<p class=" text-light mb-4">
  I went through some academic studies, market reports, expert articles, and user discussions to identify common pain points and behaviors within the grocery space.
</p>

<ul class=" text-light mb-4" style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
  <li>
    <strong>Quantitative data:</strong>  Stats, surveys, market growth reports,..
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Qualitative data:</strong>  Reddit experiences, shopper frustrations, emotional feedback,..
  </li>
</ul>

<p class=" text-light mb-4">
  Through this step, I gained a better understanding of the current retail landscape and shopper psychology.

<h3 class="subsection-title ">Competitive Analysis</h3>
<p class=" text-light mb-4">
  After exploring blogs and reports, I explored a few similar apps, checked out their features, read user reviews to see how they approach in-store navigation and grocery shopping. This helped me get a clearer idea of what’s already working and more importantly, what users still need. Here's what I found.
</p>

<div class="col-14 col-md-12 col-lg-10 mx-auto text-center mb-4">
  <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="competitive analysis.png" style="max-width: 70%;" alt="alt="Dashboard visualizing key insights from user research at local grocery store>
  </div>

<p class="text-light mb-4 section-spacing">
  While I gathered some useful takeaways from these apps, most of them were international, mainly from the U.S. 

Unfortunately, I couldn’t find any Indian apps with similar in-store navigation features to explore or review firsthand.
So yes, there’s a limitation here. But I still got a solid idea of what’s already out there, what works, and more importantly what users still struggle with.
</p>
<p>
These insights gave me a good starting point and helped shape the next step: talking to real users through Primary Research
</p>

<h3 class="responsive-style section-spacing">PRIMARY RESEARCH</h3>
<p>
  To understand the real people behind the problem, I visited a local grocery store in my hometown and talked directly with 4-5 shoppers. I chose this store, since it closely resembled the type of store my app is targeting, in terms of layout, scale, and shopper flow.
</p>

    <h3 class="subsection-title">On the Ground Research
    </h3>
    <p class=" text-light mb-4">
      I didn’t have a strict target persona in mind — but I made sure to include a mix of people from different demographics:
    </p>
    <ul class=" text-light mb-4">
      <li>Elderly shoppers</li>
      <li>Busy working professionals</li>
      <li>Young adults</li>
      <li>People with visible mobility issues</li>
    </ul>

    <p class=" text-light mb-4">
      I tried to avoid biases while choosing participants. I noticed people who looked like they might face a problem while shopping, and I approached them.
    </p>

    <p class=" text-light mb-4">
      I introduced myself and made my purpose clear to them, and asked for their permission. Obviously, some people declined to participate. But a few were ready to share their experiences, and I thanked them for their valuable time. I made it clear that there were no right or wrong answers, just honest experiences. I used my native language to make them feel more comfortable.
    </p>
    
    <p class=" text-light mb-4">Based on these interactions, I mapped out key shopper traits and patterns.</p>

</div>



<h3 class=" subsection-title">Key Learnings</h3>
<p>Beyond assumptions, i got a clear idea of how real shoppers think. These are the common pain points i noted</p>
    <ul class="small text-light mb-4">
      <li>Shoppers feel overwhelmed by long aisles, especially when in a rush.</li>
      <li>They plan in advance but still end up missing items.</li>
      <li>Some rely on staff, but not everyone is comfortable doing that.</li>
      <li>Many avoid certain sections entirely.</li>
      <li>Layout complexity, crowding and stock availability are major concerns</li>
    </ul>

    <p class=" text-light mb-4">
      These real human struggles helped me realize — the solution isn’t just about maps or cool features. It’s about easing confusion, planning better, and making shopping feel less like a chore.

  <h3 class="responsive-style section-spacing">AFFINITY MAP</h3>

<p class="text-light mb-4">
  After gathering rich insights from both secondary and primary research, I organized my findings into an Affinity Map using FigJam. This helped me group similar observations and identify recurring patterns in shopper behavior and pain points. The goal was to move from scattered observations to clear, actionable design directions.

<h3 class="responsive-style section-spacing">EMPATHY MAP</h3>

<p class="text-light mb-4">
   Using the themes from the affinity map, I created an empathy map to step into the user's sheos and better understand their mindset, motivations, and frustrations.

<h3 class="subsection-title">Key Patterns Identified</h3>
<ul class="text-light mb-4">
  <li>Shoppers often feel overwhelmed by long or poorly organized aisles</li>
  <li>Planning helps, but many still forget or miss items</li>
  <li>Store layouts and wayfinding are major barriers to smooth shopping</li>
  <li>Assistance from staff is helpful but not always accessible</li>
  <li>Users want more independence and control in-store</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="responsive-style section-spacing">USER PERSONA</h3>
<p class="text-light mb-4">
  Based on the research, I created a representative persona to help guide decisions moving forward.

<h3 class="responsive-style section-spacing">PROBLEM STATEMENT</h3>
<div class="glass-card">
  <p class="glass-text">
    Shoppers in large grocery stores often struggle to navigate the space efficiently, leading to stress, missed items, and a poor shopping experience. There’s a need for a simple, intuitive way to help them plan and move through the store with ease.
