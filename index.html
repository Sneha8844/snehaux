<p class="small disclaimer-text mb-3">
  Disclaimer: Since this is a prompt from my Google UX Certification course, it’s a hypothetical case. I referred to Google and other websites to do the secondary research. For the primary research, I visited a local store near my hometown that’s similar to the one I’m designing, to interact with real shoppers.
</p>
<h3 class="responsive-style bottom-spacing top-spacing">SECONDARY RESEARCH</h3>
<p class=" text-light mt-4">
  Also known as desk research. I think this stage is crucial to understand the field, spot gaps and learn about real pain points  people facing during an instore grocery shopping. Since, i have limitations to do expensive/ time-consuming research processes. This gives real insights rather than assuming. I collected data’s relevant to the context. Here’s what i found:

<h3 class="subsection-title ">Contextual Insights</h3>
<p class=" text-light mb-4">
  I went through some academic studies, market reports, expert articles, and user discussions to identify common pain points and behaviors within the grocery space.

<h3 class="subsection-title">Competitive Analysis</h3>
<p class=" text-light">
  After exploring blogs and reports, I explored a few similar apps, checked out their features, read user reviews to see how they approach in-store navigation and grocery shopping. This helped me get a clearer idea of what’s already working and more importantly, what users still need. Here's what I found.
</p>

<div class="col-20 col-md-14 col-lg-12 text-center mt-5 mb-5">
  <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="competitive analysis.png" style="max-width: 100%;" alt="alt="Dashboard visualizing key insights from user research at local grocery store>
  </div>

<p class="text-light">
  While I gathered some useful takeaways from these apps, most of them were international, mainly from the U.S. 

Unfortunately, I couldn’t find any Indian apps with similar in-store navigation features to explore or review firsthand.
So yes, there’s a limitation here. But I still got a solid idea of what’s already out there, what works, and more importantly what users still struggle with.
</p>
<p>
These insights gave me a good starting point and helped shape the next step: talking to real users through Primary Research
</p>
</div>

<h3 class="responsive-style bottom-spacing top-spacing">PRIMARY RESEARCH</h3>
<p class="mt-4">
  To understand the real people behind the problem, I visited a local grocery store in my hometown and talked directly with 4-5 shoppers. I chose this store, since it closely resembled the type of store my app is targeting, in terms of layout, scale, and shopper flow.
</p>

    <h3 class="subsection-title">On the Ground Research</h3>
    <p class=" text-light mb-4">
      I didn’t have a strict target persona in mind — but I made sure to include a mix of people from different demographics:
    </p>
    <ul class=" text-light mb-4">
      <li>Elderly shoppers</li>
      <li>Busy working professionals</li>
      <li>Young adults</li>
      <li>People with visible mobility issues</li>
    </ul>

    <p class=" text-light mb-4">
      I tried to avoid biases while choosing participants. I noticed people who looked like they might face a problem while shopping, and I approached them.
    </p>

    <p class=" text-light mb-4">
      I introduced myself and made my purpose clear to them, and asked for their permission. Obviously, some people declined to participate. But a few were ready to share their experiences, and I thanked them for their valuable time. I made it clear that there were no right or wrong answers, just honest experiences. I used my native language to make them feel more comfortable.
    </p>
    
    <p class=" text-light mb-4">Based on these interactions, I mapped out key shopper traits and patterns.</p>

</div>


<h3 class=" subsection-title">Key Learnings</h3>
<p>Beyond assumptions, i got a clear idea of how real shoppers think. These are the common pain points i noted</p>
    <ul class="small text-light mb-4">
      <li>Shoppers feel overwhelmed by long aisles, especially when in a rush.</li>
      <li>They plan in advance but still end up missing items.</li>
      <li>Some rely on staff, but not everyone is comfortable doing that.</li>
      <li>Many avoid certain sections entirely.</li>
      <li>Layout complexity, crowding and stock availability are major concerns</li>
    </ul>

    <p class=" text-light mb-4">
      These real human struggles helped me realize — the solution isn’t just about maps or cool features. It’s about easing confusion, planning better, and making shopping feel less like a chore.

  <h3 class="responsive-style bottom-spacing top-spacing">AFFINITY MAP</h3>

<p class="text-light mt-4">
  To see patterns more clearly, I dumped all my findings onto sticky notes in FigJam and began clustering them. It was a bit messy at first, but gradually, I grouped similar observations and identify recurring patterns in shopper behavior and pain points. The goal was to move from scattered observations to clear, actionable design directions. 
  These groupings helped me uncover deeper user needs, I might’ve missed otherwise.
</p>

  <img src="affinity map.png" alt="Affinity Map" class="img-fluid rounded" style="max-width: 90%;">
</div>

<h3 class="responsive-style bottom-spacing top-spacing">EMPATHY MAP</h3>

<p class="text-light mt-4">
   At this point, I wanted to go beyond just what people were saying and get closer to how they were feeling. As I began noticing recurring patterns in the affinity map, I realized that evaluating each individual persona in detail might become difficult to refer back to later. So, I created three fictional user stories that collectively represent the eight people I interacted with. These characters emerged naturally as I synthesized emotions, habits, behaviors, and needs from the affinity map. Building empathy maps for these fictional users allowed me to step into real shoppers’ shoes and better understand their mindsets. That’s when I realized :
‘I got closer to designing for people, not just for problems.’
</p>

<h3 class="responsive-style bottom-spacing top-spacing">USER PERSONA</h3>
<p class="text-light mt-4">
  Instead of treating personas as a separate step, I built them alongside the empathy maps, letting the insights naturally evolve into relatable human stories. While creating empathy maps, I had already shaped three distinct character types to represent the core user groups I observed during my research. Summarizing these into distinct personas became a key step that shapes everything ahead. A quick reference point to ensure that every design decision I make later truly reflects the people I’m designing for.That means, throughout the design process, I can always come back to these characters to double-check: “Am I designing with them in mind?”

<h3 class="responsive-style bottom-spacing top-spacing">PROBLEM STATEMENT</h3>
<p class="text-light mt-4">
  The patterns, the emotions, the context,.. with all of this in front of me, I was finally able to zoom in and define the actual problem.
It wasn’t just “people get lost in grocery stores.”
It was more like: “People are overwhelmed, short on time, and need a smarter way to shop without the stress.”
</p>
<div class="glass-card mt-4">
  <p class="glass-text" style="color: #bbb; font-weight: 300;">
    Even <span style="color: #fff; font-weight: 400;">regular grocery shoppers</span> often feel lost or mentally exhausted <span style="color: #fff; font-weight: 400;">navigating the store,</span> especially when <span style="color: #fff; font-weight: 400;">tired, rushed, or managing shared lists.</span> Despite knowing the layout, <span style="color: #fff; font-weight: 400;">they backtrack, they skip items,</span> or <span style="color: #fff; font-weight: 400;">hesitate to ask staff.</span> Existing signs and categories don’t always match how people actually think or shop. This creates a <span style="color: #fff; font-weight: 400;">frustrating, inefficient experience</span> that affects both <span style="color: #fff; font-weight: 400;">shopper satisfaction and store sales.</span>
  </p>
</div>
<p class="text-light mt-4">
  This clear problem statement became the compass for my next steps. I needed to design a solution that feels intuitive, helpful, and actually makes a difference.

  <h1 class="text-success fw-bold mb-3 bottom-spacing top-spacing text-center">IDEATE</h1>

  <p class="small fst-italic text-center mb-5" style="color: #aaa;">Shaping clear direction from user insights</p>
  <p>Ideation is critical stages in the design thinking process, so as soon as all necessary information was gathered before this phase, I started working on generating ideas.</p>


  <h3 class="responsive-style bottom-spacing top-spacing">CRAZY 8'S</h3>

<p class="text-light mt-4">
  I started with brainstorming ideas. I got an blurred sight of the features i can bring as the solution. From that point i get prepared for the crazy 8 method. Also known as the rapid-fire sketching method. I gave myself just 1 minute per idea — 8 ideas in 8 minutes.
Without overthinking much, I sketched out quickly and loosely.</p>
<p>
Absolutely, I can’t say or think they were perfect to move forward. I spended more time ideating things. and when i feel stuck or confused, i checked the personas again and lead the ideation more user-centric. And iteration process led me to move to task tree for the further improvements i can think for deeper clarity.
</p>

  <h3 class="responsive-style bottom-spacing top-spacing">TASK TREE</h3>

<p class="text-light mt-4">
After brainstorming, I started structuring those ideas into a task tree. I identified four main sub-goals a user must complete to achieve the main goal — an efficient shopping experience:
</p>
<ul class="small text-light mb-4">
      <li>Searching/browsing items</li>
      <li>Preparing the shopping list</li>
      <li>Navigating the store</li>
      <li>Completing the shopping process</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class=" text-light mb-4">
    With these sections in mind, I began sketching a flow to map how a user would move through each goal. I then mapped out the tasks under each goal to understand the step-by-step journey.
    </p>

<div class="col-17 col-md-15 col-lg-13 mx-auto text-center mb-4">
  <img src="task flow.png" alt="Task tree flow" class="img-fluid rounded" style="max-width: 90%;">
</div>

<p class=" text-light mb-4">
  While doing Crazy eight’s, I came up with many ideas, but when I mapped them against the task flows, I realized some were unnecessary. The task tree helped me prioritize which features and interactions were absolutely necessary for the MVP. It also helped me narrow my focus to the core goals and think in a clear, linear path without overcomplicating things, ensuring the experience stayed simple and intuitive.
  </p>


<h3 class="responsive-style bottom-spacing top-spacing">USER FLOW</h3>

<p class="text-light mt-4">
   I connected all the flows I plotted in the task tree into a single sequence to sketch out the user flow. I tried to imagine everything from the user’s perspective ‘How they might move through the app smoothly from start to finish’. I mapped out every possible path, from opening the app and searching for products to creating a list, sharing it with others, navigating in-store, and marking items as purchased.
  </p>

  <div class="col-16 col-md-14 col-lg-12 mx-auto text-center mb-4">
  <img src="user flow.png" alt="User Flow" class="img-fluid rounded" style="max-width: 90%;">
  </div>

<p class="text-light mt-4">
  Seeing the entire journey laid out like this helped me fine-tune transitions and make sure there were no unnecessary steps. This flow clearly shows how a user interacts with the app at every point: what screens they visit, what decisions they make, and how they reach their goal.
</p>
<p class="text-light mt-4">
  It also highlighted edge cases, such as what happens if a user skips list creation or jumps straight to navigation. Or what if a user need to reuse or edit past list without creating a new one...  Mapping it visually made it much easier to identify where users might get stuck or where extra guidance was needed.
</p>
<p class="text-light mt-4">
  Overall, this gave me a clear picture of the entire user journey and where I could improve things before moving into detailed design
</p>



<h3 class="responsive-style bottom-spacing top-spacing">SITEMAP</h3>

<p class="text-light mt-4 mb-6">
   To make the app’s structure clear and intuitive, I mapped everything out into a sitemap, almost like creating a blueprint for the app.
  </p>
  <p class="text-light mt-4 mb-6">
    I started with the Home Page, the first screen users land on, and branched out to the core areas they’d likely need most: Browse Items, Shopping List, In-store Navigation, Profile, and Suggestions.
  </p>
  <p class="text-light mt-4 mb-6">
  For instance, Browse Items leads directly to Item Details, where users can quickly add things to their list or locate them in-store. Shopping List goes deeper into collaboration features, like sharing with others or managing edits, because the real scenarios I found from research showed a need to sync grocery lists with families or roommates.
  </p>

<div class="col-17 col-md-15 col-lg-13 mx-auto text-center mt-4 mb-4">
  <img src="IA.png" alt="Sitemap" class="img-fluid rounded" style="max-width: 90%;">
</div>

<p class="text-light mt-4">
While the task tree gave me clarity on goals, and the user flow showed the journey, the sitemap ensured that everything was organized in a way that felt natural and effortless for someone shopping with one hand on the cart and the other on their phone.
</p>
<p class="text-light mt-4">
This IA gave me a confident starting point for wireframes, knowing the app’s backbone was aligned with real user needs and scenarios.

<h3 class="responsive-style bottom-spacing top-spacing">WIREFRAME</h3>

<p class="text-light mt-4">
With a clear picture of the structure in mind, I began drafting the wireframes in a Figma design file. This stage was less about visuals and more about ensuring that every section had a clear purpose and could be accessed within just a few taps.
</p>

<h3 class="subsection-title">Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
<p class="text-light mt-4">
I jumped straight into mid-fidelity wireframes, focusing on framing the screens and flows that mattered most for the app. Even though this was just a blueprint of the design, I wanted to bring the ideas to life to start solving the problem. Here are the first iterations I created:
