  “What if grocery shopping felt as smooth as online shopping, but in a real store?”
</blockquote>

<p class="tops-spacing">That’s the whole thing I was trying to sort out with <strong>Grovia</strong>, my way of making grocery shopping a little less frustrating. So, let’s dive into the story:</p>
  
  <div class="tops-spacing">
  <h4 class="subsection-title">The Problem</h4>
  <p>
    In today’s fast-paced lives, grocery shopping is still feeling like a tedious chore. Most shoppers waste time finding products and locating them. Wandering through aisles, scanning every shelf, and stopping to ask the staff for help... relatable, right? 
  </p>
  <p>
    Even store owners are feeling the pressure: Dealing with staffing issues, Trying to keep things running smoothly, and Making sure customers actually enjoy the experience enough to come back. It’s not that simple as we think.
  </p>
  </div>

  <div>
  <h4 class="subsection-title">The Context - Why Now?</h4>
  <p>
    After the Covid lockdowns, more and more people have gotten used to shopping online. It’s quick, easy, and we don’t have to leave the house. Compared to the convenience of online shopping, walking through a store started to feel slow and kind of outdated. Because of that, many grocery stores are still struggling to bring customers back in.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even in my own neighborhood, I noticed that big stores didn’t really have any smart tech to help shoppers. People looked tired and frustrated, when they couldn’t find everything they needed. That’s when I realized maybe in-person grocery shopping just needed a little upgrade. Something that could make it feel as easy and smooth as shopping online.
  </p>
  </div>

  <div>
  <h4 class="subsection-title">The UX Challenge</h4>
  <p>
    Shoppers would be actively moving through the store while using the app. Which means, they'd be multitasking between picking up items with one hand and phone in the other. So, the flow needed to be extremely simple and distraction-free. And ofcourse, flexible enough for all kinds of shoppers, no matter their age or level of tech comfort.

    When I first started working on Grovia, I knew I didn’t want to jump straight into designing screens. I just wanted to gain better clarity of the actual problem, without guessing it. So, I followed a design thinking approach to make sure I was solving the right problems in the right way. Here's how the whole journey happened, step by step.

  Disclaimer: Since this is a prompt from my Google UX Certification course, it’s a hypothetical case. I referred to Google and other websites to do the secondary research. For the primary research, I visited a local store near my hometown that’s similar to the one I’m designing, to interact with real shoppers.
</p>
<h3 class="responsive-style bottom-spacing top-spacing">SECONDARY RESEARCH</h3>
<p class="mt-4">
  Also known as desk research. I think this stage is crucial to understand the field, spot gaps and learn about real pain points  people facing during an instore grocery shopping. Since, i have limitations to do expensive/ time-consuming research processes. This gives real insights rather than assuming. I collected data’s relevant to the context. Here’s what i found:
</p>
<h4 class="subsection-title ">Contextual Insights</h4>
<p class="mb-4">
  I went through some academic studies, market reports, expert articles, and user discussions to identify common pain points and behaviors within the grocery space.

  <li>
    <strong>Quantitative data:</strong>  Stats, surveys, market growth reports,..

    <strong>Qualitative data:</strong>  Reddit experiences, shopper frustrations, emotional feedback,..

</ul>

<p class="mb-4">
  Through this step, I gained a better understanding of the current retail landscape and shopper psychology.

<h4 class="subsection-title">Competitive Analysis</h4>
<p>
  After exploring blogs and reports, I explored a few similar apps, checked out their features, read user reviews to see how they approach in-store navigation and grocery shopping. This helped me get a clearer idea of what’s already working and more importantly, what users still need. Here's what I found.
</p>

<div class="col-20 col-md-14 col-lg-12 text-center" style="margin-top: 4rem; margin-bottom: 3rem;">
  <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="images/competitive analysis.png" style="max-width: 100%;" alt="alt="Dashboard visualizing key insights from user research at local grocery store>
  </div>

<p>
  While I gathered some useful takeaways from these apps, most of them were international, mainly from the U.S. 

Unfortunately, I couldn’t find any Indian apps with similar in-store navigation features to explore or review firsthand.
So yes, there’s a limitation here. But I still got a solid idea of what’s already out there, what works, and more importantly what users still struggle with.
</p>
<p>
These insights gave me a good starting point and helped shape the next step: talking to real users through Primary Research
</p>
</div>

<h3 class="responsive-style bottom-spacing" style="margin-top: 10rem;">PRIMARY RESEARCH</h3>
<p class="mt-4">
  To understand the real people behind the problem, I visited a local grocery store in my hometown and talked directly with 4-5 shoppers. I chose this store, since it closely resembled the type of store my app is targeting, in terms of layout, scale, and shopper flow.
</p>

    <h4 class="subsection-title">On the Ground Research</h4>
    <p class="mb-4">
      I didn’t have a strict target persona in mind — but I made sure to include a mix of people from different demographics:
    </p>
    <ul class="mb-4">
      <li>Elderly shoppers</li>
      <li>Busy working professionals</li>
      <li>Young adults</li>
      <li>People with visible mobility issues</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-4">
      I tried to avoid biases while choosing participants. I noticed people who looked like they might face a problem while shopping, and I approached them.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      I introduced myself and made my purpose clear to them, and asked for their permission. Obviously, some people declined to participate. But a few were ready to share their experiences, and I thanked them for their valuable time. I made it clear that there were no right or wrong answers, just honest experiences. I used my native language to make them feel more comfortable.
    </p>
    
    <p class="bottom-spacing">Based on these interactions, I mapped out key shopper traits and patterns.</p>

</div>


<h5 class="mt-5 mb-3" style="color:#e7ffcb;">Key Learnings</h5>
<p>Beyond assumptions, i got a clear idea of how real shoppers think. These are the common pain points i noted</p>
    <ul class="small mb-4">
      <li>Shoppers feel overwhelmed by long aisles, especially when in a rush.</li>
      <li>They plan in advance but still end up missing items.</li>
      <li>Some rely on staff, but not everyone is comfortable doing that.</li>
      <li>Many avoid certain sections entirely.</li>
      <li>Layout complexity, crowding and stock availability are major concerns</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-4">
      These real human struggles helped me realize — the solution isn’t just about maps or cool features. It’s about easing confusion, planning better, and making shopping feel less like a chore.

  <h3 class="responsive-style bottom-spacing top-spacing">AFFINITY MAP</h3>

<p class="mt-4">
  To see patterns more clearly, I dumped all my findings onto sticky notes in FigJam and began clustering them. It was a bit messy at first, but gradually, I grouped similar observations and identify recurring patterns in shopper behavior and pain points. The goal was to move from scattered observations to clear, actionable design directions. 
  These groupings helped me uncover deeper user needs, I might’ve missed otherwise.
</p>

</div>

<h3 class="responsive-style bottom-spacing" style="margin-top: 13rem;">EMPATHY MAP</h3>

<p class="mt-4 mb-5">
   At this point, I wanted to go beyond just what people were saying and get closer to how they were feeling. As I began noticing recurring patterns in the affinity map, I realized that evaluating each individual persona in detail might become difficult to refer back to later. So, I created three fictional user stories that collectively represent the eight people I interacted with. These characters emerged naturally as I synthesized emotions, habits, behaviors, and needs from the affinity map. Building empathy maps for these fictional users allowed me to step into real shoppers’ shoes and better understand their mindsets. That’s when I realized :
‘I got closer to designing for people, not just for problems.’

<h3 class="responsive-style bottom-spacing" style="margin-top: 13rem;">USER PERSONA</h3>
<p class="mt-4 mb-5">
  Instead of treating personas as a separate step, I built them alongside the empathy maps, letting the insights naturally evolve into relatable human stories. While creating empathy maps, I had already shaped three distinct character types to represent the core user groups I observed during my research. Summarizing these into distinct personas became a key step that shapes everything ahead. A quick reference point to ensure that every design decision I make later truly reflects the people I’m designing for.That means, throughout the design process, I can always come back to these characters to double-check: “Am I designing with them in mind?”

<h3 class="responsive-style bottom-spacing" style="margin-top: 13rem;">PROBLEM STATEMENT</h3>
<p class="mt-4">
  The patterns, the emotions, the context,.. with all of this in front of me, I was finally able to zoom in and define the actual problem.
It wasn’t just “people get lost in grocery stores.”
It was more like: “People are overwhelmed, short on time, and need a smarter way to shop without the stress.”
</p>

<div class="card-custom card-full mt-5 mb-5">
  <div class="step-description" style="font-size: large; padding: 0.7rem;">
    Even <span style="color: #fff; font-weight: 400;">regular grocery shoppers</span> often feel lost or mentally exhausted 
    <span style="color: #fff; font-weight: 400;">navigating the store,</span> especially when 
    <span style="color: #fff; font-weight: 400;">tired, rushed, or managing shared lists.</span> Despite knowing the layout, 
    <span style="color: #fff; font-weight: 400;">they backtrack, they skip items,</span> or 
    <span style="color: #fff; font-weight: 400;">hesitate to ask staff.</span> Existing signs and categories don’t always match how people actually think or shop. 
    This creates a <span style="color: #fff; font-weight: 400;">frustrating, inefficient experience</span> that affects both 
    <span style="color: #fff; font-weight: 400;">shopper satisfaction and store sales.</span>
  </div>
</div>


<p class="mt-4">
  This clear problem statement became the compass for my next steps. I needed to design a solution that feels intuitive, helpful, and actually makes a difference.

  <p>Ideation is critical stages in the design thinking process, so as soon as all necessary information was gathered before this phase, I started working on generating ideas.</p>


  <h3 class="responsive-style bottom-spacing top-spacing">CRAZY 8'S</h3>

<p class="mt-4">
  I started with brainstorming ideas. I got an blurred sight of the features i can bring as the solution. From that point i get prepared for the crazy 8 method. Also known as the rapid-fire sketching method. I gave myself just 1 minute per idea — 8 ideas in 8 minutes.
Without overthinking much, I sketched out quickly and loosely.</p>
<p>
Absolutely, I can’t say or think they were perfect to move forward. I spended more time ideating things. and when i feel stuck or confused, i checked the personas again and lead the ideation more user-centric. And iteration process led me to move to task tree for the further improvements i can think for deeper clarity.
</p>

  <h3 class="responsive-style bottom-spacing" style="margin-top: 8rem;">TASK TREE</h3>

<p class="mt-4">
After brainstorming, I started structuring those ideas into a task tree. I identified four main sub-goals a user must complete to achieve the main goal <span style="color: #fff;"> an efficient shopping experience:</span>
</p>
<ul class="small text-light mb-4">
      <li>Searching/browsing items</li>
      <li>Preparing the shopping list</li>
      <li>Navigating the store</li>
      <li>Completing the shopping process</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="mb-5">
    With these sections in mind, I began sketching a flow to map how a user would move through each goal. I then mapped out the tasks under each goal to understand the step-by-step journey.
    </p>

<div class="col-20 col-md-19 col-lg-18 mx-auto text-center mt-5 mb-4">
  <img src="images/task flow.png" alt="Task tree flow" class="img-fluid">
</div>

<p class=" mb-5">
  While doing Crazy eight’s, I came up with many ideas, but when I mapped them against the task flows, I realized some were unnecessary. The task tree helped me prioritize which features and interactions were absolutely necessary for the MVP. It also helped me narrow my focus to the core goals and think in a clear, linear path without overcomplicating things, ensuring the experience stayed simple and intuitive.
  </p>


<h3 class="responsive-style bottom-spacing" style="margin-top: 10rem;">USER FLOW</h3>

<p class="mt-4 mb-5">
   I connected all the flows I plotted in the task tree into a single sequence to sketch out the user flow. I tried to imagine everything from the user’s perspective ‘How they might move through the app smoothly from start to finish’. I mapped out every possible path, from opening the app and searching for products to creating a list, sharing it with others, navigating in-store, and marking items as purchased.
  </p>

  <div class="col-16 col-md-14 col-lg-12 mx-auto text-center mb-5">
  <img src="images/user flow.png" alt="User Flow" class="img-fluid rounded" style="max-width: 90%;">
  </div>

<p class=" mt-4">
  Seeing the entire journey laid out like this helped me fine-tune transitions and make sure there were no unnecessary steps. This flow clearly shows how a user interacts with the app at every point: what screens they visit, what decisions they make, and how they reach their goal.
</p>
<p class=" mt-4">
  It also highlighted edge cases, such as what happens if a user skips list creation or jumps straight to navigation. Or what if a user need to reuse or edit past list without creating a new one...  Mapping it visually made it much easier to identify where users might get stuck or where extra guidance was needed.
</p>
<p class=" mt-4">
  Overall, this gave me a clear picture of the entire user journey and where I could improve things before moving into detailed design
</p>



<h3 class="responsive-style bottom-spacing" style="margin-top: 10rem;">SITEMAP</h3>

<p class=" mt-4 mb-4">
   To make the app’s structure clear and intuitive, I mapped everything out into a sitemap, almost like creating a blueprint for the app.
  </p>
  <p class=" mt-4 mb-4">
    I started with the Home Page, the first screen users land on, and branched out to the core areas they’d likely need most: Browse Items, Shopping List, In-store Navigation, Profile, and Suggestions.
  </p>
  <p class=" mt-4 mb-5">
  For instance, Browse Items leads directly to Item Details, where users can quickly add things to their list or locate them in-store. Shopping List goes deeper into collaboration features, like sharing with others or managing edits, because the real scenarios I found from research showed a need to sync grocery lists with families or roommates.
  </p>

<div class="col-17 col-md-15 col-lg-13 mx-auto text-center mt-5 mb-5">
  <img src="images/IA.png" alt="Sitemap" class="img-fluid rounded" style="max-width: 90%;">
</div>

<p class=" mt-4">
While the task tree gave me clarity on goals, and the user flow showed the journey, the sitemap ensured that everything was organized in a way that felt natural and effortless for someone shopping with one hand on the cart and the other on their phone.
</p>
<p class=" mt-4">
This IA gave me a confident starting point for wireframes, knowing the app’s backbone was aligned with real user needs and scenarios.

  <p class="small fst-italic text-center mb-5" style="color: #aaa;">Shaping clear direction from user insights</p>
  

<h3 class="responsive-style bottom-spacing top-spacing">WIREFRAME</h3>

<p class=" mt-4" style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
With a clear picture of the structure in mind, I began drafting the wireframes in a Figma design file. This stage was less about visuals and more about ensuring that every section had a clear purpose and could be accessed within just a few taps.
</p>

<h4 class="subsection-title">Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</h4>
<p class=" mt-4 mb-5">
I jumped straight into mid-fidelity wireframes, focusing on framing the screens and flows that mattered most for the app. Even though this was just a blueprint of the design, I wanted to bring the ideas to life to start solving the problem. Here are the first iterations I created: 
</p>

<h3 class="subsection-title">Iterations</h3>
<p style="color: #bbb;">Each iteration was tested conceptually against user needs and pain points</p>

<h4 class="solution-heading" style="margin-top: 5rem;">#1 Home screen</h4>
<section class="design-section">
  <!-- Intro Text -->
  <div>
    The home screen design began with identifying key user intents: search, browse, navigate, or resume a list.
    I structured the initial layout placing all these actions upfront as a raw sketch of what users might need the moment they open the app.
    It was functional, but during the iteration process, I uncovered a few critical issues:
  </div>

  <!-- Before Image Left -->
  <div class="design-block">
    <div class="design-images mt-5">
      <img src="images/before-image.png" alt="Home screen design mockup" />
    </div>
    <div class="design-content mt-5" style="font-size: 0.85em;">

  <p>
    <span style="color:#e7ffcb; font-weight:600;">Primary goals stood out:</span> 
    Most users immediately search or browse for items, rather than accessing the store map or reviewing a pending list.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span style="color:#e7ffcb; font-weight:600;">Hick’s Law in action:</span> 
    Too many elements at first glance could overwhelm users, especially those who are less tech-savvy. Fewer, clearer choices make decisions faster and easier.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span style="color:#e7ffcb; font-weight:600;">Real-world context matters:</span> 
    Shoppers often handle the device in one hand while managing a cart (groceries) in the other. This means accessibility considerations (Situational accessibility) are essential.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span style="color:#e7ffcb; font-weight:600;">Visual Hierarchy:</span> 
    The elements were competing for attention, which can lead to decision fatigue.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span style="color:#e7ffcb; font-weight:600;">Navigation Depth:</span> 
    Every element here leads to another screen, such as deals, map, or list, which needs careful prioritization. It also increases the number of taps to reach the final goal.
  </p>

</div>

  <!-- After Image Right -->
  <div class="design-block reverse">
    <div class="design-images" style="margin-top: -30px;">
      <img src="images/after-image.png" alt="Solution mockup" />
    </div>
    <div class="design-content mt-2" style="font-size: 0.85em;">
      <p>
        To solve this, I focused on <strong>Progressive Disclosure</strong>, surfacing only the most urgent actions first: search, followed by a high-priority offers section, then content blocks grouped by theme.
        <br><br>
        A clear <strong>Visual hierarchy</strong> helped organize this flow, while <strong>Gestalt principles</strong> like proximity and similarity guided how I grouped seasonal and popular items.
        I also considered <strong>Thumb ergonomics</strong>, ensuring that primary CTAs remained within easy reach for one-handed use.
        <br><br>
        The outcome wasn’t just cleaner, it was better aligned with how users actually move through their tasks and how the business could highlight key items without overwhelming the shopper.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

<h4 class="solution-heading" style="margin-top: 7rem;">#2 Navigation flow</h4>
<section class="design-section">
  <div class="design-content">

    <!-- Initial Design -->
    <div class="iteration-block reverse mb-5" style="margin-top: 5rem;">
      
      <div class="design-text" style="font-size: 0.85em;">
        <p style="color:#e7ffcb; font-weight:600; font-size: large;"> Initial Design</p>
        <p>
          I started by placing only the essential set of tabs to avoid overwhelming users. On the homepage, users could add items to a list or access the store map or view their profile. All as separate tabs in Bottom navigation bar.
        </p>
        <p>
          While this version was clean, it lacked quick access to search, a critical step for the majority of users to move forward.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="iteration-image">

        <p style="color:#e7ffcb; font-weight:600; font-size: large;"> Need for Exploration</p>
        <p>
          So I added "Search" tab to improve usability. Although functional, the app flow still lacked clarity. Users could add items to the list, but there was no clear call-to-action (CTA) button to proceed. They often had to return to the homepage or navigate via the bottom nav bar. Users have to think, what to do next? That’s a UX failure.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="iteration-image">

    <!-- Floating Map Button -->
    <div class="iteration-block reverse" style="margin-top: 4rem;">
      
      <div class="design-text" style="font-size: 0.85em;">
        <p style="color:#e7ffcb; font-weight:600; font-size: large;">Floating Map Button</p>
        <p>
          To address this, I introduced a floating action button (FAB) for the "Map" on the Shopping List page. 
          The reasoning was simple:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Once users add items to the list, their primary goal is to find these items in the store.</li>
          <li>A FAB is always visible and accessible, avoiding the need to scroll or hunt for buttons (especially useful for long lists).</li>
          <li>Inspired by Fitts' Law, the FAB provided a larger tappable area, ensuring the most important action is easy and quick to access.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <div class="iteration-image">
        <img src="images/fab-button.png" alt="Floating Map Button">
      </div>

    </div>

    <!-- Find in Store CTA -->
    <div class="iteration-block reverse" style="margin-top: 4rem;">
      
      <div class="design-text" style="font-size: 0.85em;">
        <p style="color:#e7ffcb; font-weight:600; font-size: large;">“Find in Store” CTA</p>
        <p>
          However, through further exploration, I realized that a FAB: while functional, might not be easily discoverable for less tech-savvy users. Additionally, the map itself introduced multiple actions (e.g., AR navigation and store layout), which could confuse users. 
        </p>
        <p>
          To resolve this, I replaced the FAB with a clear, contextual sticky CTA button: <strong>"Find in Store"</strong>. The wording "Find in Store" explicitly communicates the action and making the purpose obvious, than an ambiguous icon.

          The main goal: finding items in store, is placed front and center
       </li>
          <li>The most critical feature (Map/Find in Store) was progressively made more visible and accessible.</li>
          <li>Decision-making was simplified by limiting navigation options to what’s necessary, as per Hick’s Law, without competing for user attention.</li>

<h4 class="solution-heading" style="margin-top: 10rem;">#3 Shopping List</h4>
<section class="design-section">

<p class="mt-5">
  The initial version was a typical straightforward shopping list, as users would expect. But after observing behaviors and mapping pain points, I realized how each micro-interaction was adding unnecessary mental load or increasing the risk of interaction errors.
</p>

<div class="col-17 col-md-15 col-lg-13 mx-auto text-center mt-5 mb-5">
  <img src="images/iteration list.png" alt="Iterations image 3" class="img-fluid rounded" style="max-width: 90%;">
</div>

<div class="mt-5 mb-3">
  <h5 style="color:#e7ffcb; font-weight:600; font-size: large;">1. Cognitive Load → Category Grouping with Gestalt</h5> 
  <p style="font-size: 0.85em;">A plain, ungrouped list quickly became overwhelming as the number of items grew. To address this, we introduced category labels, guided by Gestalt’s Laws of Proximity and Similarity. Now, users can mentally group items and scan them faster. This structure also mirrors how products are organized in stores, aligning the digital experience with the real-world shopping flow.
  </p>

  <h5 class="mt-5 mb-3" style="color:#e7ffcb; font-weight:600; font-size: large;">2. Accidental Taps → Intentional Actions</h5> 
  <p style="font-size: 0.85em;">The “X” remove icon placed at the far right of each item made accidental deletions far too easy—especially for users navigating the app while moving through a grocery store. This led to frustration and lost entries. We replaced the destructive "X" with checkboxes as the primary inline action, aligning with the natural “check-off” behavior. Items can still be undone if needed. Since deletion is rare and buying is the primary goal, this shift makes interactions more intentional and constructive.
  </p>

  <h5 class="mt-5 mb-3" style="color:#e7ffcb; font-weight:600; font-size: large;">3. Share Icon Placement → Improved Discoverability</h5> 
  <p style="font-size: 0.85em;">We moved the share icon to the conventional top-right position, following common mobile design patterns. This reduced decision time and met user expectations. Familiar patterns improve discoverability, which is critical since sharing and collaboration is an essential part in the listing stage.
  </p>

  <h5 class="mt-5 mb-3" style="color:#e7ffcb; font-weight:600; font-size: large;">4. Add Item Option → Focused Review Mode</h5> 
  <p style="font-size: 0.85em;">Even when users were focused on reviewing or editing items, the “Add Item” option was always visible. This interrupts the flow of reviewing items and adds cognitive load. Since the add item option appears directly through search or suggestions, a dedicated icon for it is not always relevant. So, I removed it from this focused view.
  </p>

  <h5 class="mt-5 mb-3" style="color:#e7ffcb; font-weight:600; font-size: large;">5. Ambiguous CTA → Clear, Contextual Call-to-Action</h5> 
  <p style="font-size: 0.85em;">A dedicated “Find in Store” button was added, tailored to the current context. Users building or viewing a list often want to locate items next. This simple, clear CTA aligns with the logical flow of the shopping journey.
  </p>
</div>

  <p style="margin-top: 6rem;">
   The updated design reduces friction by honoring user intent and ensuring every interaction feels purposeful. The focus was on reducing taps, improving efficiency, and preventing accidental errors.
  </p>
</section>

<h3 class="responsive-style bottom-spacing" style="margin-top: 13rem;">MOCKUPS</h3>

<p class="mt-4">
From the refined wireframe, after multiple iterations, I focused on making the prototype to look like an actual application. My goal was to bring all the research insights and every wireframe iteration together into these polished mockup versions. What truly challenged me wasn’t just creating a visually appealing design, but making sure that every part worked exactly as users expected. Honestly speaking, this is the stage where I spend the most time patiently refining details.
</p>
<p>Rather than just presenting static screens, I wanted to show the <strong>‘why’ behind every design decision</strong>. So, along with designing, I’ve documented the thought process behind each screen. The design reasoning below explains how the final mockups evolved from earlier wireframes and how user needs and feedback shaped the overall experience.</p>

<p class="solution-heading" style="font-size: larger; margin-top: 7rem;">Log-in screens</p>
<div class="mt-5">
<div class="col-15 col-md-12 col-lg-10 mx-auto text-center mt-5 mb-5">
  <img src="images/log-in screens.png" alt="Iterations image 1" class="img-fluid rounded" style="max-width: 90%;">
</div>
<p>The login flow is kept minimal with a single field and one-tap sign-in, avoiding tedious multi-field forms. Since it’s just a simple wayfinding app (no payments or sensitive info), a quick email verification is enough. Alternative login options like Google and Apple, can make the process super easy. Users can even skip login to explore the app first, and only sign up later if they want to save lists or personalize their experience. “Contact Support” help link are available at every step, ensuring users never feel stuck. Minimal distractions and a clear hierarchy in UI elements ensure that the user’s attention stays on completing the task.
</p>


<p class="solution-heading mb-2" style="font-size: larger; margin-top: 7rem;">Onboarding screens</p>
<div class="mt-5">
<div class="col-15 col-md-12 col-lg-10 mx-auto text-center mt-5 mb-5">
  <img src="images/onboarding screens.png" alt="Iterations image 1" class="img-fluid rounded" style="max-width: 90%;">
</div>
<p>A simple 3-step onboarding screens quickly introduces the app’s core values to new users like jotting down lists, teaming up with others, and finding items faster in-store with AR. When it comes to the permissions screen, it clearly explains why each access is needed, building trust while keeping control in the user’s hands. To reduce mental load, I combined all required app permissions into a single screen with clear CTA buttons, instead of showing multiple pop-ups right after entering the app. The overall flow is designed to give users clarity and confidence in the app from the very start
</p>


<p class="solution-heading mb-2" style="font-size: larger; margin-top: 7rem;">Home browsing</p>
<div class="mt-5">
<div class="col-12 col-md-10 col-lg-8 mx-auto text-center mt-5 mb-5">
  <img src="images/home exploration.png" alt="Iterations image 1" class="img-fluid rounded" style="max-width: 90%;">
</div>
<p>The homepage is designed to feel familiar and easy browsing. A warm “SHOP WITH EASE!” welcome message paired with an “OPEN” status badge instantly tells store availability, reducing unnecessary friction or wasted time. The search bar is front and center, while categories are arranged in the same order as the physical store, making navigation feel intuitive. For deal-seekers, discounts and clearance offers are placed in the middle to grab attention fast. Personalized sections like Seasonal Arrivals are structured to catch users eye without feeling pushy. </p>
<p>Tapping on any Category brings the user to a clean grid layout structure, giving equal visual weight to each product, making it easy to scan quickly, even in a rush. Each card shows only what’s needed along with a thumb-friendly CTA button, which makes adding items effortless with just one tap. Filter tabs are designed like pills to match common mobile behaviors.</p>
<p>Selecting a product, say ‘Black Plums,’ takes users to a product detail screen. It’s styled to feels like picking up and inspecting an item in-store. From Price to origin, all useful info's are arranged in a simple, logical order. Ratings and reviews build trust, helping users decide faster. Key actions like “Find in Store” and “Add to List” are placed side by side, keeping the next steps obvious and smooth.</p>


<p class="solution-heading mb-2" style="font-size: larger; margin-top: 7rem;">Search items</p>
<div class="mt-5">
<div class="col-8 col-md-6 col-lg-5 mx-auto text-center mt-5 mb-5">
  <img src="images/search feature.png" alt="Iterations image 1" class="img-fluid rounded" style="max-width: 90%;">
</div>
<p>I initially started with an empty state design for the search page, but later I realized that it adds users the effort of thinking. So, for fast and easier searching, I added smart suggestions and recent searches. Recently searched items are placed at the top for quick recall, making repeat tasks faster, while pre-filled suggestions with common grocery tags make effortless exploration without typing. I introduced the voice search to reduce typing effort, after noticing in research that many less tech-savvy users feel more comfortable speaking than typing. It’s quicker, easier, and aligns with how they already use their phones. The results page follows the same grid layout as the browsing screens, ensuring a consistent design pattern across the app.
</p>


<p class="solution-heading mb-2" style="font-size: larger; margin-top: 7rem;">Shopping List</p>
<div class="mt-5">
<div class="col-20 col-md-17 col-lg-15 mx-auto text-center mt-5 mb-5">
  <img src="images/shopping list.png" alt="Iterations image 1" class="img-fluid rounded" style="max-width: 90%;">
</div>
<p>The shopping list is designed to feel effortless and collaborative, almost like a smarter version of a handwritten list. If no list has been created yet, an empty state with a clear “Browse Items” CTA button guides users to start building their list right away. Within the list, items are grouped by category, allowing users to quickly skim through and check off items while shopping. I also added a feature to invite family or friends to create lists together, since sharing and collaboration were key insights from user research. Clear labels show who added what, so everyone stays in sync.</p>
<p>For navigation, I introduced two options: an AR view for smooth, step-by-step item locating, and a store map as a backup if AR fails to load or for users who prefer a traditional layout. This gives users flexibility and control, letting them choose the experience that works best for them.
</p>


<p class="solution-heading" style="font-size: larger; margin-top: 7rem;">Navigation flow</p>
<div class="mt-5">
<div class="col-20 col-md-17 col-lg-15 mx-auto text-center mt-5 mb-5">
  <img src="images/Item locating.png" alt="Iterations image 1" class="img-fluid rounded" style="max-width: 90%;">
</div>
<p>When designing the navigation flow, I kept in mind, i want the experience to feel more like a clear guidance than just another tech feature. Basically, i started with designing 2 navigation options: AR way finding and store map. By combining AR with a store map, users get both an innovative experience and a reliable fallback. So that users can choose what suits their comfort level with technology. Both options are optimized to follow the shortest possible route through the store.
</p>
<p>The AR navigation setup requires users to position their phone correctly, so I added visual guidance with friendly instructions to ensure even first-time users feel at ease and I used simple progress indicators to make users aware of the system is setting up in background.
</p>
<p>Since shoppers use this feature while actively purchasing groceries, often multitasking, so the AR interface is designed with minimal distractions to keep the focus clear. A small item card with essential details about the next product is placed at the bottom of the screen, along with a “Got it” button positioned within thumb reach for easy, one-handed use.
</p>
<p>For those who naturally prefer an overview of the store layout, the store map offers a clean, traceable path, creating a familiar and easy-to-follow experience. Once all items are checked off, a “Shopping Complete” screen celebrates task completion to give users a sense of closure while quietly saving their list in the background.</p>
<p>Overall, the strategy was to blend innovation (like AR) with familiar patterns, ensuring the app feels modern yet approachable for all shoppers.</p>

<p>The Notifications screen is structured to make updates instantly actionable. Filter tabs allow users to filter content based on what they care about most. Each notification card uses concise language and a clear CTA, like “Add to List” or “View History,” so users can act immediately without extra steps. Time indicators is placed to make sure users, that they don’t miss time-sensitive deals or reminders. I intentionally kept the color palette neutral for the visual cues, so the focus remains on the content.</p>
<p>The History screen is designed to make it easy for users to review and reuse past shopping lists. Instead of starting from scratch every time, users can simply restore a previous list with just a tap and edit it. Filter tabs above give users a clear separation of personal and collaborative lists. Each list card highlights essential info like creation date or join date, with list thumbnails providing quick visual recognition. To minimize friction, I added a search bar on the top, helping users quickly find older lists without scrolling. Subtle actions like “Review” or “Restore” appear contextually only when needed, keeping the interface clean and distraction-free. Every element on these screens was shaped by the principle of quick recognition over recall.</p>

<h3 class="responsive-style bottom-spacing top-spacing">USABILITY TEST</h3>
<p class=" mt-4">
To refine the experience, I did some usability testing to really understand how people were using the app. Watching them interact with the design helped me catch small but important issues that I hadn’t noticed during wireframing. This phase taught me a lot about how users actually think, what confuses them, and how even tiny changes can make the whole experience feel way more smooth and intuitive.
</p>

<h3 class="subsection-title">Moderated Usability Study</h3>

<p class="small disclaimer-text mb-3">
  Disclaimer: This was an informal usability study done with people around me. While it wasn’t a full-scale user lab test, I still gained meaningful insights by observing real reactions to the prototype.
</p>

<h5 class="responsive-style mt-5" style="color: fff;">Goals</h5>
<p class="mt-3" style="color: #bbb;">
  The main goal was to test whether users could easily complete key tasks using the prototype. I mainly wanted to know:
</p>
<ul class=" mb-4" style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 1.5rem; color: #bbb;">
  <li>
    Can users do the tasks easily without instructions?
  </li>
  <li>
    Do users get confused or stuck anywhere?
  </li>
  <li>
    How does the app feel in overall?
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 class="responsive-style mt-5" style="color: fff;">Participants</h5>
<p class=" mt-3" style="color: #bbb;">
  I tested the prototype with 3 people around me who had experience with in-store grocery shopping. Since this is a personal project, I not chose formal participants, but real everyday shoppers who could give me honest, instinctive feedback. I observed them as they used the prototype on my phone.
</p>

<h5 class="responsive-style mt-5" style="color: fff;">Task scenarios</h5>
<p class=" mt-3" style="color: #bbb;">
  Realistic Tasks I asked them to try, without any instructions:
</p>
<ul class="mb-4" style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 1.5rem; color: #bbb;">
  <li>
     Find and add “Black plums” and “Bread” to your shopping list.
  </li>
  <li>
    Try navigating the store using the AR feature.
  </li>
  <li>
    Mark an item as bought once you reach it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Find your previous shopping lists and restore.
  </li>
  <li>
    Try sharing your list with someone.
  </li>
</ul>

<p class=" mt-3" style="color: #bbb;">
  While they doing the tasks I asked to do, I observed their reactions quietly and asked feedback after they done. Based on this test, I made a few key changes to improve the experience.
</p>


<h3 class="subsection-title">Iterations</h3>
<p style="color: #bbb;">Each iteration was tested conceptually against user needs and pain points</p>

<h4 class="solution-heading mb-2">#1</h4>
<div class="mt-5">
  <p>After testing, a few users mentioned that the green path blended too much with the store’s background. Those users, were above 40+ ages and having mild vision issues. That feedback made me think, if the path isn’t instantly visible, the whole experience fails. So I chose the brighter blue path, which pops out clearly for everyone, regardless of vision differences. Blue is more vibrant, attention-grabbing color and is commonly used in navigations. The refined version is making the navigation route instantly clear and effortless to follow. Also making sure is more inclusive for color-blind users.

  <p class="small fst-italic mt-4" style="color: #aaa; margin-bottom: 8rem;">Before vs After: Path Visibility That Works for Everyone</p>
</div>

<h4 class="solution-heading mb-2">#2</h4>
<div class="mt-5 mb-2">
  <p>Another insight i got from usability testing is that many users were unsure about the purpose of the ‘+’ icon, often mistaking it is for ‘add to cart’ button due to common e-commerce habits. To remove this confusion, I applied the visibility of system status principle to make the action clear. I introduced a system status pop-up feedback, that shows recently added items and a quick ‘View List’ button. This small change improved user confidence and reduced hesitation while adding products.

<p class=" text-light bottom-spacing top-spacing" style="color: #bbb;">
  This whole journey from early research to final design, every step helped me see the product a little more clearly, not just through my eyes, but through the eyes of real users. I began with a bare mind and some rough ideas, and ended up with a smooth, working app that actually makes sense for the end users.
</p>


<h4 class="subsection-title">Future Scope</h4>
<p style="color: #bbb;">While working on this project, a few ideas came up that I’d love to explore further, (if I get the time) to make the app even more helpful and convenient for everyday shopping:</p>

<ul class=" mb-4" style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 1.5rem; color: #bbb;">
  <li class="mb-3">
     <strong>Integrating Self-Checkout:</strong> To make shopping even quicker and easier, a self-checkout feature can be added so that users can skip long queues and complete their purchases without relying on staff. Users can simply scan and pay for items through the app.
    </li>
  <li>
     <strong>Personalized Suggestions Based on Shopping Habits:</strong> By analyzing what users usually buy or which sections they visit most, the app could offer personalized deals and product recommendations. This can help users save time and money while discovering items they're likely to be interested in.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="subsection-title">What This Project Taught me</h4>
<ul class=" mb-4" style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 1.5rem; color: #bbb;">
  <li class="mb-3">
    Designing with real users in mind makes all the difference. I began the project with a lot of assumptions, but seeing how actual people interact with the app made me think of frustrations, that I hadn’t considered till then.
  </li>
  <li class="mb-3">
    Building a simple experience is the challenge, but it’s worth it. I used to think adding more features made the app better, but this project reminded me that clarity and ease-of-use matter way more.  Simplifying the flow to the essentials often make the biggest positive impact.
  </li>
  <li class="mb-3">
    I had to constantly find the right balance between making things intuitive for new users and keeping features powerful enough for regular users. considering inclusivity, I have to balance both.
  </li>
  <li class="mb-3">
    During usability study, I found that most users skip reading. For them visuals and clarity matter more than clever UI. (but still writings are important for people who rely on screen reading)
  </li>
  <li class="mb-3">
    Design is never really done. spending time by relying on assumptions, perfecting the design, thinking of better result and testing revealed I was wrong. This project taught me that good design doesn’t happen all at once. It’s an ongoing process of trying things, testing them, and learning what actually works.
  </li>
</ul>
